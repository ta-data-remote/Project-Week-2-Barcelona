## Project Description <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>
This project analyzes the accessibility of public transportation in Barcelona. 
Hereby the focus is on the number of bus, metro and/or taxi stops in certain areas e.g. around sightseeings.
We chose this project because we believe we can draw conclusions on the density of the various elements offered by the public transportation entity. 

## Questions & Hypotheses <a class="anchor" id="questions-hypotheses"></a>
-Nº of bus stops, metro, taxi stops per Region
-Percentage of missing values in columns: District and Neighborhood
-Nº of metro stations, bus stops, etc in a given district with an important sightseeing/cultural element, ex: Sagrada familia Cathedral is in ''Eixample'' District
-What types of factors make public transport less/more accessible (frequent, ex: more schools, hospitals means more bus stops?)
-Mean prices, time per distance covered, frequency of buses on time of day (how much less frequent are the buses if it's night time, holiday, etc)

Hypothesis: We think that there is a positive correlation between the number of bus/metro/taxi stops and the location of sightseeings. 


## Dataset <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>
Transportation --> bus-stops.csv
Transportation --> public-transport.csv
own file with the locations of the most important sightseeings (source: Wikipedia)
