## Project Description
In this project we will introduce you an analysis of the most frequent names in the city of Barcelona in the last century.


## Questions & Hypotheses
We would like to answer questions like the following ones:
- Which are the most frequent names for every decade?
- Are the names changing through the time?
- Can we infer any population tendency based on the names?
- Is there any foreign influence appearing lately?


## Dataset
We used a public databese named *most_frequent_names: 50 Most common names of the inhabitants of Barcelona, disaggregated by decade of birth and sex.* from the website Barcelona Open Date [Dataset](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/organization/demografia)

## Database
The database was imported as a Comma-Separated Values (CSV)

## Workflow
1 - Choosing a database related to the city of Barcelona
2 - Asking questions and making hypothesis
3 - Exploring and cleaning data using Pandas library
4 - Finding some insights and final conclusions
