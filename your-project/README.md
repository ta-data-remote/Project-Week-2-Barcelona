## Project Description
Our project explores the Urban Environment Dataset for Barcelona, where we analyse patterns of three different pollutants: O3, NO2 and PM10.
The research shows pollution evolution over the day, week and month. It also offers an overview of the areas within Barcelona that are most affected.

## Questions & Hypotheses
- When can we see the highest levels of pollution?
- Which areas are most affected by pollution?
- Are there significant changes of pollution levels during the day? And during the week?

## Dataset
We used the Urban Evironment Dataset for Barcelona, which offers hourly and daily pollution levels for O3, NO2 and PM10. It covers one month of time (November, 2018)


## Workflow
Our first step was to plan our timeline. After deciding on our deadlines we divided the project in tasks and investigated a series of questions that could be interesting to explore within our dataset.

## Organization
We used a Kanban board to keep track of our tasks for the project. We summarized our necessary steps in this board and had regular check ins everyday.
