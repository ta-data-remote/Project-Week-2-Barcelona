## Project Description
For this project we cleaned, reorganized and manipulated a dataset on accidents in Barcelona for the year 2017, to make it more meaningful.
We answered exciting questions on which neighborhood, date, time and street type is the most dangerous in terms of accidents.

## Questions
Q1: Which neighborhood was the most dangerous in Barcelona in 2017 in terms of injuries and victims/vehicles?

Q2: In terms of injuries, victims and vehicles involved, which were the most dangerous times of the year 2017?

This section explores:

Which months, and which part of the month had the most accidents.
Which days are the most dangerous in terms of transportation accidents.
During which time of the day accidents happen more frequently?

Q3: Which types of streets are more prone to accidents? Highways, intersections or normal roads?

Q3.1: What is the most common type of accidents in terms of injuries and vehicles involved?

## Dataset
We used this Transportation data set: accidents-2017.csv - you can find it in our repo under " datasets".

## Database
The structure of our database is similar to a report with sections going over our workflow and answering the questions. Within these sections we included tables and descriptions.

## Workflow
1. Organization via trello
2. First look at data
3. Data cleaning
4. Data analysing
5. Data manipulation
6. Conclusions
7. Presentation

## Organization
We organised our project with trello into tasks which are either to do, in progress, done or in review. We also assigned deadlines to some tasks in order to be reminded.

On the first level our repository has a .gitignore file and 2 folders containing the datasets (datasets) as well as our code (your-project).
The folder "your-code" contains our readme file and 3 jupiter notebooks. We each worked on our workstation or the master_project file in order to not get in conflict with each other.
The master_project workbook contains the final code.
