## Project Description
- In this project, we are assigned to work in a team of 3 people to analyse a provided dataset from Barcelona. 
- We are supposed to select only one dataset from the given list and we decided to work on - "Most frequent baby names in     
  Barcelona".


## Questions & Hypotheses
* Search for the 10 most frequent names for male and female over the total time span
* Find the top 3 names from each year - with highest frequency in each year
* International vs. given local names for male & female
* Checking total counts for names starting with A,D, E
* Preferred shortest & longest name - for male and female
* Find Spanish names occurring in our class are in the data set
* Comparison of percentage share male and female during full period

## Dataset
- We selected a dataset called - "Most frequent baby names in Barcelona".
- Dataset was already provided in the project file. 

## Database
* Our dataset has 5 columns and total 1050 entities. We have equally split dataset for male and female names.
* We have added new tables after analysing dataset according the our results.


## Workflow
