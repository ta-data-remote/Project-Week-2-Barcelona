## Project Description
Our project explores the Urban Environment Dataset for Barcelona, where we analyse patterns of three different pollutants: O3, NO2 and PM10.
The research shows pollution evolution over the day, week and month. It also offers an overview of the areas within Barcelona that are most affected.

## Questions & Hypotheses
When can we see the highest levels of pollution?

Which areas are most affected by pollution?

Are there significant changes of pollution levels during the day? during the week?

## Dataset
We used the Urban Evironment Dataset for Barcelona, which offers hourly and daily pollution levels for O3, NO2 and PM10.


## Workflow
Our first step was to plan our timeline. After deciding on our deadlines we divided the project and started a list of questions that could be interesting to explore with our dataset.

## Organization
We used a Kanban board to keep track of our tasks for the project. We summarized our necessary steps in this board and had regular check ins everyday.
